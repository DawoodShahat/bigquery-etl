A powerful feature of the clients_last_seen methodology is that it doesn't record specific metrics like MAU and WAU directly, but rather each row stores a history of the discrete days on which a client was active in the past 28 days. We could calculate active users in a 10 day or 25 day window just as efficiently as a 7 day (WAU) or 28 day (MAU) window. But we can also define completely new metrics based on these usage histories, such as various retention definitions. The usage history is encoded as a \"bit pattern\" where the physical type of the field is a BigQuery INT64, but logically the integer represents an array of bits, with each 1 indicating a day where the given clients was active and each 0 indicating a day where the client was inactive. range Return an INT64 representing a range of bits from a source bit pattern.
